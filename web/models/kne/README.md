This is where KNe models (light curves) go for calculating model detection efficiencies.

These KNe models are from Metzger (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41114-017-0006-z), 
parameterized by ejecta mass (Mej, [Msol]), ejecta velocity (vej [c]), and electron fraction (Ye).

The full parameter space for these models range Mej in [0.001, 0.5] Msol, vej in [0.001, 0.5] c, and 
Ye either 0.45 (blue KN) or 0.1 (red KN), range in time [0.1, 150.0] days, and are partitioned in 36 runs for 
computational efficiency.
