This is where linear models (light curves) go for calculating model detection efficiencies.

Linear decline models have parameters, M in [-21, -12] mag, dM in [0.001, 2] mag/day, and time step [0, 15] 
days. Models are grey with equal flux in each band, and are partitioned in 100 runs for computational 
efficiency.
